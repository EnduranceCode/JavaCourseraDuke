# Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization

The [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) offered by [Duke University](https://www.coursera.org/duke) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java. In addition to learning Java, the students who takes this specialization will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data. These software engineering skills are broadly applicable across wide array of industries.


There are four Courses in this Specialization:

1. [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming);

2. [Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data);

4. [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java);

5. [Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance).

## About this repository

All the code written while taking the [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) will be stored in different branches of this repository. This approach is taken in order avoid having this [GitHub account](https://github.com/EnduranceCode) bloated and cluttered with many repositories holding very small projects.

[Blue J](https://www.bluej.org/) will no be used in the coding tasks of this Specialization because the goal is to gain more proficiency with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) and therefore, all the necessary code will be written with Eclipse.

## Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

The resources for the [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) course are available at [www.dukelearntoprogram.com](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com) in the course's [page](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2).

#### Assignment: Parsing Weather Data

The code written for the assignment *Parsing Weather Data* is stored in the branch [course1/week3/assignment-parsing-weather-data](https://github.com/EnduranceCode/JavaCourseraDuke/tree/course1/week3/assignment-parsing-weather-data).

### Week 4 - Mini Project: Baby Names

The code written for the mini project *Baby Names* is stored in the branch [course1/week4/project-baby-names](https://github.com/EnduranceCode/JavaCourseraDuke/tree/course1/week4/project-baby-names).

For this mini project, it's provided data on baby names from the United States and it's necessary to write code to answer questions about given data. The data files give information on the first names of people born in a particular year. There is data from 1880 through 2014 on both boys and girls names. The data is stored in the folder `src/data`.

## Object Oriented Programming in Java

The [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java) is an intermediate Java course offered by 
[UC San Diego](https://www.coursera.org/ucsd) through Coursera. This course is recommended to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science.  The goal is that by the end of this course the student feels empowered to create a Java program thatâ€™s more advanced than any of programs created in the past and that is personally interesting to the learner. In achieving this goal the student will also learn the fundamentals of [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, and how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data.

This course is project-based and in the project for this course the student builds his own interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. Both powerful and challenging, data visualization is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day!

To create this project, I'll be working with a package called [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/), which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations. It was developed by Till Nagel and the team at the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.en.fh-potsdam.de/) along with other contributors and we (UC San Diego and I) are grateful that they developed such a cool package that we can build on for this course.

As part of this package, the SQLite library (version 3.7.2) is included. UC San Diego and I gratefully acknowledge [xerial.org](https://xerial.org/) for creating this [Java library](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/) and [D. Richard Hipp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Richard_Hipp) for the development of SQLite.

The project is separated into several parts, and I will be able to achieve project milestones as I work through the modules in the course. Throughout the project, UC San Diego has suggested extensions and ideas for adding extra features to this project.

### Week 1

No code was written in the first week of this course curriculum.

### Week 2

The code written for this project during the second week of this course curriculum is stored in the branch [course3/week2/unfolding-maps](https://github.com/EnduranceCode/JavaCourseraDuke/tree/course3/week2/unfolding-maps).
