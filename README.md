# Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization

The [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) offered by [Duke University](https://www.coursera.org/duke) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java. In addition to learning Java, the students who takes this specialization will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data. These software engineering skills are broadly applicable across wide array of industries.


There are four Courses in this Specialization:

1. [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming);

2. [Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data);

4. [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java);

5. [Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance).

## About this repository

All the code written while taking the [Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming) will be stored in different branches of this repository. This approach is taken in order avoid having this [GitHub account](https://github.com/EnduranceCode) bloated and cluttered with many repositories holding very small projects.

[Blue J](https://www.bluej.org/) will no be used in the coding tasks of this Specialization because the goal is to gain more proficiency with [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) and therefore, all the necessary code will be written with Eclipse.

## Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

The resources for the [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming) course are available at [www.dukelearntoprogram.com](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com) in the course's [page](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2).

The documentation for the **Course Code Packages** *edu.duke* and *org.apache.commons.csv*, available in the resources of this course (and included in the `lib/` folder of this repository), is available at the [Course Class Documentation](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/javadoc/index.html?course=2) pages.
